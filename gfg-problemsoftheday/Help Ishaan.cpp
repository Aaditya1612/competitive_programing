// Ishaan has been given a task by his teacher. He needs to find the Nth term of a series. His teacher gives him some examples to help him out (Refer examples below). He is a bit weak in pattern searching so to help him his teacher told him that the Nth term is related to prime numbers. The Nth term is the difference of N and the closest prime number to N. Help him find the Nth term for a given N.

// Example 1:

// Input: N = 10
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Closest prime to 10 is 11.
// Example 2:

// Input: N = 7
// Output: 0
// Explanation: Closest prime to 7 is 7.

// Your Task:
// You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function NthTerm() which takes N as input paramater and returns Nth term.

// Expected Time Complexity: O(N* âˆš N)
// Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

// Constraints:
// 1 <= N <= 100000
